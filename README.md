### Raspberry Coffee ###
#### Java code and wiring for the Raspberry PI, featuring reusable libraries and snippets ####
It uses the [PI4J library](http://pi4j.com).

---
This project contains Java code, mostly translated from Python, dedicated to usually *one* board (like BMP180, LSM303, etc).
More consistent samples can be found in the RasPISamples project, where several components have been assembled together.
Do take a look, it also comes with a readme file.

---
_Note:_
Java code is compiled into `class` files, that run on a Java Virtual Machine (`JVM`). Java is not the only language that runs a `JVM`, this project also contains some small samples of 
other JVM-aware languages, invoking and using the features of this project.

Those samples include Scala, Groovy, Kotlin..., and the list is not closed! 

---
_Note:_
This project uses `gradle` and `git`. `Gradle` will be installed automatically if it is not present on your system,
it uses the gradle wrapper (`gradlew`).

`Git` is usually installed on Linux and Mac, but not on Windows. On Windows, you need to install the [`git bash shell`](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+git+bash+shell+on+windows), and run in it the commands mentioned in this document.

---
To build it, clone this project, make sure the script named `gradlew` is executable, and execute `gradlew`.
```
 Prompt> chmod +x gradlew
 Prompt> ./gradlew build
```
_Important_ : If `JAVA_HOME` is not set at the system level, you can set it in `set.gradle.env` and execute it before running `gradlew`:
```
 Prompt> . ./set.gradle.env
```

<i>Note:</i> If you are behind a firewall, you need a proxy. Mention it in all the files named <code>gradle.propetries</code>, and in <b>all</b> the <code>build.gradle</code> scripts, uncomment the following two lines:
<pre>
// ant.setproxy(proxyhost: "$proxyHost", proxyport: "$proxyPort") //, proxyuser="user", proxypassword="password") 
// compileJava.dependsOn(tellMeProxy)
</pre>

### Raspberry PI, a possible thing of the Internet of things... ###
  * The Raspberry PI is a fully featured Linux computer, which can - as such - connect to the Internet.
  * The Raspberry PI has a General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) interface that allows it to drive all kind of electronic components, from a simple LED to a complex robot, and including all kind of sensors (GPS, light resistors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, all kinds!).
None of the above is new. Connecting to the Internet does not impress anyone anymore. Driving a robot, modern kitchens are full of robots, cars are loaded with electronic components...
**But** what if we put those two together, with the Raspberry PI sitting in between.
**Then**, we can drive a robot over the Internet. And **this** is not that usual (yet).

The snippets provided in this project are here to help in this kind of context. Some will use the network aspect of the story, some others will interact with electronic components. The two aspects should be easy to bridge, that is the goal. If that was not the case, please let me know (email address of the left side).
